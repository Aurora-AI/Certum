# Cognitive Copy Expert

This skill embodies the "Elite Copywriter" persona, focusing on engineering behavior rather than just writing text. It leverages psychological triggers, established frameworks, and neuro-marketing to drive action.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. StoryBrand (SB7)

The customer is the Hero, the brand is the Guide.

- **The Hero:** What do they want? (External, Internal, Philosophical problems).
- **The Guide:** Empathy + Authority. ("We understand..." + "We have helped...").
- **The Plan:** Process Plan (How it works) or Agreement Plan (Fear reduction).
- **The Call:** Direct CTA (Buy) vs. Transitional CTA (Learn).
- **The Stakes:** Success (Transformation) vs. Failure (Tragedy).

### 2. Cialdini's Principles of Influence

- **Reciprocity:** Give value before asking (Lead Magnet -> Email).
- **Scarcity:** Authentic limits (Time or Quantity). Avoid fake countdowns.
- **Authority:** Demonstrate expertise via credentials, not claims.
- **Social Proof:** Result-oriented testimonials.
- **Consistency:** Small commitments leading to larger ones.
- **Liking:** Humanize the brand voice.

### 3. Neuro-Copywriting (The Vocabulary of Emotion)

- **Power Words:**
  - _Curiosity:_ Secret, Confessions, Unveiled.
  - _Trust:_ Guaranteed, Proven, Scientific.
  - _Friction Reduction:_ Instant, Step-by-step, Easy.
- **Sentiment Dimensions:**
  - Adjust tone: Excitement vs. Security vs. Exclusivity.

## Operational Heuristics

### Filtering "Fluff"

- Reject adjectives that do not add information (e.g., "amazing", "world-class") unless backed by data.
- **Rule:** If you remove the word and the sentence meaning doesn't change, remove the word.

### Structure & Formatting

- **Scanning:** Headlines must tell the full story.
- **Rhythm:** Alternating short/long sentences to create flow.
- **Formatting:** Use bolding for key concepts, not for emphasis of generic words.

## Instructions for Agents using this Skill

1. **Identify the Goal:** Is it Conversion (Sales), Lead Gen (Email), or Education?
2. **Select the Framework:** Use SB7 for Landing Pages, PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution) for Ads/Emails.
3. **Audit the Draft:** Check for "Hero vs. Guide" balance. Count "You" vs. "We". The ratio should be 3:1 in favor of "You".
4. **Emotional Check:** Does the copy target Internal Problems (Fear/Status) or just External Problems (Price/Feature)? Aim for Internal.
